7. Short answer question: You have to design a card with React. Which of the two would
you design. Also write down your reasoning for your answer.
A) Either A or B
B) A only
C) B only
D) I do not know

Answer : c) B only  
Reason: In terms of user experience, image B appears magnificent.
        
        case 1: In image B, the environment returns larger than in image A. The environment is uniformly associated with the image tag, 
                making it more prominent.
        case 2: In image B, housekeeping returns in bold, creating a more impactful subtitle compared to image A.
        case 3: In image B, the context color is less dim, enhancing readability compared to the subtitle.
        case 4: In image B, the "posted on 03 May" text aligns with the context color and pixel consistency,
                reinforcing a cohesive visual presentation.
    
    Therefore, image B is fully formatted for an enhanced user experience
